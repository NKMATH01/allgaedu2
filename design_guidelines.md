I cannot access external URLs or GitHub repositories directly. To create comprehensive design guidelines for your project, I need more information about what you're building.

Please provide details about:

1. **Project Type**: What kind of application is this? (e.g., landing page, web app, dashboard, portfolio, e-commerce, social platform, productivity tool)

2. **Purpose**: What does your application do? What problem does it solve?

3. **Key Features**: What are the main functionalities users will interact with?

4. **Target Audience**: Who will use this application?

5. **Design Preferences** (if any): 
   - Do you want it to look like any specific website/app?
   - Any preferred style? (modern, minimal, bold, playful, professional)
   - Any specific requirements for layout or components?

6. **Content Type**: Will it be image-heavy, text-focused, data-driven, or a mix?

Alternatively, you can:
- Describe the project in detail here
- Paste relevant code/files that show what you're building
- Share screenshots if available
- Explain the current state and what needs to be completed

Once you provide this information, I'll create detailed, production-ready design guidelines tailored specifically to your project.
